                <h3>Though they are friends, Professor X and Magneto have differeing opinions on how to integreate in the world as Mutants.</h3>
                <p>Professor X wants Mutants to use their special abilities to help the world and humans, so both species can be cordial and thrive in the same environment.</p>
                <p>Magneto on the otherhand, has a distrust with humans and wants to protect his own people by using their mutant abilities to enhance their own lives and achieving as musch as possible, by any means necessary.</p>
                <p>Therefore, these friends/foes clash over their ideas often. Professor X along with the X-Men, try to stop Magneto and his band of mutants from wreaking havoc amongst humans. </p>
