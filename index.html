                <h3>Eddie Brock, first develops his hatred of Spider-Man during Spider-Man’s Sin-Eater storyline, where Spider-Man discovers the masked gunman Sin-Eater who killed his friend, police captain Jean DeWolff, is actually fellow police officer Stan Carter. While Brock doesn’t appear in the original comic book story, it’s later revealed that Brock (who in the comics is a reporter like in the Venom film) wrote a series of articles claiming another man, Emil Gregg, was the Sin-Eater. When Spider-Man exposes the real Sin-Eater, Brock’s journalistic career is ruined and he begins blaming Spider-Man for ruining his life.</h3>

                    <p>The Origin History of Venom begins with the creature that would become Venom being born to a race of extra-terrestrial symbiotes which lived by possessing the bodies of other life forms. These parasites would empower their victims with superior physical abilities at the cost of fatally draining them of adrenaline.</p>
                    <p>Eddie Brock was the first person to become Venom and by far my favorite Venom. Eddie was a reporter for The Daily Globe before it comes to light that he had fabricated a story revealing the identity of the Sin-Eater. Shortly after the story was published Spider-Man pursued and captured the real Sin-Eater disgracing Brock as a news reporter and costing him his job and then his wife.

                <p>An ex navy seal member of the United States, he had the highest count of confirmed kills amongst everyone in his unit.</p>
                <p>Eventually, Killmonger was recruited into a Joint Special Operations Command ghost unit associated with the CIA as a highly skilled black ops mercenary. Operating within the JSOC unit, he went off the grid in order to commit assassinations and take down foreign governments on behalf of the United States. As the highly-skilled soldier, Stevens was responsible for eliminating dozens of hostiles, cutting his skin with tribal Crocodile Scarring, with one for each kill. Due to his ruthlessness, while serving within the military, thus earning himself the nickname “Killmonger”.

                <h3>Even with them being family members, Killmonger hates Black Panther and Wakanda. Killmonger's father was killed by his brother, the previous king of Wakanda (Black Panther's Father), then he was abandoned in Harlem, and since then he has seeked revenge on Wakanda.
                </h3>
                <P>When Killmonger becomes an adult, he goes into Wakanda and challenges Black Panther for the throne. He wanted to become the king of Wakanda, to use the vibranium technology that Wakanda uses to help all the black communities around the world that had been oppressed for hundreds of years. But his main goal was to get revenge for his father.</P>
                <p>Black Panther would later be defeated by Killmonger in their duel for the throne. Killmonger throws Black Panther off the side of the waterfall and becomes the new king of Wakanda.</p>
                <p>Though everyone presumed that Black Panther was dead, he would later come back and kill Killmonger, reclaiming the throne of Wakanda.
